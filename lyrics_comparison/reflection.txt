I am very interested in music production and I find that many pop songs nowadays have very similar lyrics, especially ‘love songs’. This is why I chose to compare the similarity between different modern musicians in their lyrics. The two sources I chose were five songs from Billie Eilish and five songs from Lauv. For comparison, I chose one Lauv song, one Billie Eilish song, five Ariana Grande songs and five Troye Sivan songs. It is worth noting that all of these artists are soloists and write in the same genre. Additionally, I excluded any songs that were written as a collaboration to avoid other artists’ lyrical style in the comparison. All the lyrics were taken from the same website (azlyrics.com).Interestingly, all the songs used for comparison ended up being most similar to Billie Eilish’s songs. My guess is either she has more lyrical diversity in her works (her vocabulary varies a lot throughout her songs) or the other artists’ lyrics are more specific to the theme of their song. Perhaps I could have included more controlled variables for this test, such as only sourcing and comparing artists’ songs from the same album. Rather than comparing different artists, I could have compared one artist’s songs between albums. Additionally, I could have one chosen ‘one type’ of song, such as a ballad or love song. Overall, I think the classification system would work better with full works of text since song lyrics are rather short and often reuse the same words due to theme, rhythm, rhyme, etc. I think the easiest way to make this system more accurate would be to add more attributes to the TextModel class. That way, the methods will have more data from compared parameters, producing a more accurate result.
